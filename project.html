        <h2>OVERVIEW.</h2>
        <p>As more individuals and businesses become reliant on cloud storage providers to store their content, the risk of doing so increases with the lack of essential cybersecurity features on even the most popular cloud storage services. In this
          project, I shed a light on these concerns by designing an app that makes such features available to users interested in effectively securing and monitoring their content, while also giving them the ability to create content and safely
          collaborate with whomever they choose. </p>

            <h2>PROBLEM.</h2>
            <p>The core of the problem was to create a cloud storage app that allows for collaboration with others. However, before doing so, I needed to clarify how this app could alleviate existing problems that aren’t being addressed well by
              competitors or could be approached in a different, yet effective, manner.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>SOLUTION.</h2>
            <p>By analyzing competitors (Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox) and doing user research, I discovered that there was a need for collaboration-friendly cloud storage services prioritizing user safety with the inclusion of features such as
              private-encryption, heightened password security, and content monitoring. The app should address these concerns in addition to being a stress-free space for creation, collaboration, and the sharing of content with others.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <div>
              <p>To find the appropriate target audience for this app, I had to learn more about the competition (Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox). </p>
              <ol>
                <li>What is their purpose? What do they represent?</li>
                <li>What do they consider their best features?</li>
                <li>How do their users perceive their services? </li>
              </ol>
              <p>After some secondary research, I quickly found enough information to compare competitors. My resources include competitor websites, user reviews, and comparison articles.</p>

              I hoped to find answers to the following questions with the survey:</p>

              <p>The demographic data gathered from the user survey reveals that respondents come from a variety of different backgrounds. I narrowed down on the appropriate target audience for my app by focusing less on whom the respondents are and
                more on the nature of who they are.
                By doing so, I produced the following personas:</p>

                  <p>Now in her senior year of college, Aaliyah has a lot to keep up with. Her final academic year is littered with group projects, accompanied with an intensive capstone and intimidating exams that require endless note-taking and
                    concentration. If she’s going to survive the year, she’ll need to worry less about studying harder and instead study smarter. Aaliyah likes to keep track of her life by journaling each day and does candid photo-taking in the

                  <p>Aaliyah has had a Google account for quite some time now and a majority of her peers have one too. Always collaborating with other students, she takes class notes in real time with her peers while class is in session. Using
                    cloud storage has also allowed her to keep all of her documents in one place without having to worry about carrying around an external hard drive to free up space on her own computer,  Chromebook. However, the lack of private
                    encryption will become an issue in the future as soon as she begins her professional journalism career.</p>

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>Giving my strategy a skeleton let me analyze my interpretation of research results and expose any cracks in the framework that needed redressing. Sketching concepts out on paper allowed me to focus on hierarchy and rapidly sort
                through various layout ideas at a time. The simplicity of sketching prevented me from lingering on distracting details that come with digital wireframing or immediately designing hi-fi mockups. Once finished, I fleshed out my
                wireframes in Sketch and then organized them into a clickable prototype.</p>

              <h4>To Tutorial or Not Tutorial?</h4>
              <p>Before running usability tests on my lo-fi prototype, I pushed it through two sessions of <strong>Bloc's Daily Design Critique (DDC)</strong>. At this point, the prototype had an empty state encouraging the users to upload or create
                a file to get started.</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/tutorial/dashboard1.png" alt="user flows" width="900" height="544">
              <p>This is the original wireframe for Ark’s dashboard empty state before recieving feedback to make it more diretional.</p>
              <p>In the first DDC, I was made aware that a user inexperienced with cloud storage interfaces may be in need of a walkthrough for their first interaction. With this in mind, I designed more wireframes that welcome users to the app and
                give them access to a tutorial.</p>

              <p>This is the wireframe for the tutorial I created for Ark’s dashboard.</p>
              <p>I then sent the updated prototype to be reviewed for a second time. The reviewer was not the same person, and the tutorial received a response that somewhat contradicted the feedback I embraced earlier. After completing the
                onboarding process, he was greeted with a welcome screen asking if he would like to proceed to the tutorial.</p>
              <p>“Oh no, a tutorial!” he nervously exclaimed.</p>
              <p>Hearing the anxiety in his voice was enough for me to reconsider how I introduced the tutorial. It would need to be presented passively and not in the form of an assertive pop-up. I didn't want users to stop using the app because
                they assumed the interface is complex or had a high learning curve. For now, I would remove the tutorial to test the usability of the site and would address the problem after testing.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The dashboard is reminiscent of Google Drive, so much that testers' first instinct was to drag files across the screen when asked to place it into a folder. Unfortunately, this is not achievable in Invision, so they had to think
                  for a moment before clicking elsewhere.</li>
                <li>Highlighted features in the tutorial were perceived as clickable, although they weren’t</li>
                <li>A tester liked that all pages are accessible from the dashboard</li>

              <h3>Branding Work</h3>
              <p>I revisited the competitive-analysis to determine the best positioning for the brand. My research showed me that positioning my brand as a solution to an ever growing problem in cybersecurity would be the best strategy. </p>
              <p>Next, I had to create a brand identity reflecting the app’s attention to cybersecurity and its collaborative features.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The Brand Name</p>
              <p>I chose “Ark” as the brand name because it means “large box,” which is appropriate for describing a secure cloud storage system. It can also mean “a place of refuge.” </p>
              <p>The Logo</p>
              <p>I originally wanted to take advantage of ark’s homophonic counterpart, “arc,” and use it in branding. However, I chose to use a triangular arch instead. The triangle is considered the most secure shape and its form, embodying the
                brand’s focus on security. </p>
              <div>
                <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/logo-sketch-1.jpg" alt="first logo sketch" width="288" height="171">
                <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/logo-sketch-2.jpg" alt="second logo sketch" width="288" height="171">
                <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/logo-sketch-3.jpg" alt="third logo sketch" width="288" height="171">
                <p><strong>Top three logo concepts I sketched out for Ark.</strong> Left – the chosen logo concept, a metallic arc. Center – an arch formed from a stripped silhouette. Right – A space ship in the form of a three dimensional “A”</p>
              </div>
              <p>After sketching out many thumbnails, I landed on a few favorites. I chose to use the last thumbnail because it had a structure that could work on both small and large scale mediums. Based on feedback from my mentor, I separated the
                graphic logo from the text for flexibility.</p>
              <p>Moodboard</p>
              <p>Cloud storage gives people access to a much larger space beyond their hard drives. I wanted to reflect this by utilizing the idea of "the cloud" and space, both from a cosmic and design perspective. The mood board presents many
                colors, contrasts, and vibrancies, all of which were influenced by nebulas suspended in space and the spectrum of colors produced from the sun as it aligns with Earth's horizon.</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard">
              <p>This is the moodboard I created via Pinterest to pinpoint the aesthetic I desired to apply to Ark’s branding. </p>
              <p>Logo Refinements</p>
              <p>Logo concepts were sketched on paper first. Then, I chose what I considered the best design and digitized it in Figma. </p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/logo-refinements.png" alt="logo refinements" width="668" height="661">
              <p>These are the black and white logos I created for Ark. I used a gradient to help me enivision how color would have an effect on the logo when added.</p>
              <p>Brand Color</p>
              <p>I assigned blue as the brand’s primary color after doing some research into color psychology. Often associated with trust, responsibility, and security, this was the color that aligned with the personality of the brand best.</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/logo-brand-color.png" alt="added brand color" width="670" height="612">
              <p>This is the logo with a potential brand color applied. I would later opt for a flatter design, but the ideas was for the logo to resemble the blue light often associated with cybersecurity.</p>
              <p>The Right Color Palette</p>
              <p>Choosing a color palette for the brand took contemplation and experimentation. I had a specific look in mind, but what I brewed up in color scheme generators would not suffice. After suffering through enough trial and error, I tried
                an alternative method. I extracted colors from the mood board I created for the project and made a few gradients. Here are the results:</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/color-scheme.png" alt="color scheme" width="900" height="369">
              <p>These are the top three color schemes I created for Ark.</p>
              <p>“What do the spheres have to do with anything?”</p>
              <p>Creating gradients in spheres made it easier for me to discern how well the colors flowed into each other, especially when comparing accent colors and background colors to one another.</p>
              <p>-</p>
              <p>Next, I ran a preference test on UsabilityHub to see which one expressed characteristics of the brand best. I received the following feedback:</p>
              <p>Which of the following color schemes best illustrates security, trust, inspiration, creativity, and wonder?</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/branding-work/preference-test-1.png" alt="color scheme preference test" width="900" height="330">
              <p>Feedback received suggested I should stick to a a blue color scheme with a green accent color based on the characteristics I hoped to reflect in the logo.</p>
              <p>The Deal with Gradients</p>
              <p>At first, I assumed gradient logos didn't have many drawbacks when designed properly, but thanks to the feedback received from my preference test, DDC, and additional research, I changed my logo for the following reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gradients don’t always transfer well on digital mediums and rarely work well on print</li>
                <li>Scaling down would remove the accent color in my logo from sight</li>
              </ul>
              <div>
                <div>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>Updates to the Color Palette</p>
              <p>I experienced some challenges when designing my hi-fi mockups with the heavily blue color palette voted on by testers. The light green primary buttons weren’t as prominent as I would have liked against navy backgrounds, especially
                the homepage. It was too monochromatic and needed a pop of color to add warmth and vibrancy to the design. After taking a gander at the color wheel and checking out its psychological properties, orange became the secondary color. </p>
              <p>Finding the Right Type</p>
              <p>I chose Roboto Black as the brand typeface and Open Sans as the complementary typeface because of how well the two complements both the weight and personality of the brand and logo. Roboto Black mirrors the structure and weight of
                the logo and is also a balanced collaboration of different moods – it’s modern and warm, not too cold or geometric. Open Sans makes a great partner for Roboto because it contrasts Roboto Black in both weight and width.</p>
              <p>Challenges with Developing a brand identity</p>
              <p>The most challenging part of this phase was understanding the cybersecurity threats to cloud storage services and developing a brand from my limited knowledge. I had to ensure the problem I present through my branding was accurate
                and would make sense to the public. More research was necessary.</p>

            <h3>Applying Feedback</h3>
            <p>Mentor Suggestion: Replace the hamburger button with the logo</p>
            <p>In the original design, the hamburger button was used to toggle the sidebar navigation. The Ark word type was placed next to it for the user to recognize the platform they are using at a glance. I did not use the brand type because it
              did not align well with the hamburger button.</p>
            <p>After expressing this to my mentor, he suggested I use the brand type to replace both the hamburger button and the word type. This way, I could exhibit the brand type in the app and have it toggle the menu at the same time.</p>

              <div>
                <img src="/images/ark-case-study/applying-feedback/hamburger-menu-before.png" alt="payment plans before changes" width="490" height="294">

                <p>Dashboard’s empty state after iteration.</p>
              </div>

            <p>Learning the hamburger button wasn't mandatory was a relief. Making the change boosted the confidence I had in my design. It was coming together!</p>
            <p>DDC Panel Suggestion: Increase the size of the text in the navigation and modal windows</p>
            <p>One of the DDC panel members had difficulty reading texts in the sidebar navigation links and some modal windows due to their size. I increased their sizing to make the app accessible to those with impaired vision.</p>

            <p>Personal Changes</p>
            <p>Update the Sorting System</p>
            <p>Sorting systems play a vital role in user experiences. I did not plan to have it tested in my prototype, but sorting should always be efficient. The original design did not illustrate that.</p>
            <p>Replace “Recent Activity” with “Latest Content”</p>
            <p>After making numerous changes, the dashboard still looked like a Google Drive replica. I removed the “Recent Content” section after receiving feedback that this information was technically already touched on in the “Recents” page.</p>

              <div>

                <p>Ark’s dashboard after iteration.</p>

              </div>

            <p>I still wanted to occupy this space, so I made it a “Latest Activity” section. It would give an overview of recent activities made by others that affect the user or their content. There wasn't enough time for me to test this change,
              but I did have it reviewed and approved in DDC.</p>
            <p>Navigation System</p>
            <p>The sidebar was blending into the dashboard, so I gave it a dark linear gradient for high-contrast to help it stand out.</p>

            <p>In addition to making the text large, I made the text field style consistent with that use in the mobile mockup.</p>

            <h4>Transferring the Mobile Design to Desktop</h4>
            <p>Due to time constraints, I wanted to deliver a desktop version of the app as the MVP. However, I had to provide mobile mockups of the homepage and dashboard during the stage. I took advantage of this opportunity to design mobile
              mockups for each wireframe to gauge the app's responsiveness. Changes were made to the desktop version so that it would be consistent with Android for when I had a chance to make a mobile prototype later.</p>

              <p>Preference Tests & First-Click Tests Results</p>
              <p>Before proceeding to prototype, I ran a few preference test to help with settling unresolved design choices:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>Which style of the heading “My Content” do you prefer?</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/preference-tests/my-content-preference.png" alt="preference test for my content header" width="900" height="219">
              <p>Feedback received suggested I replace the dropshadow style applied to the “My Content” heading with a divider.</p>
              <button type="button">TAKE PREFERENCE TEST</button>
            </div>
            <div>

              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/preference-tests/layout-preference.png" alt="preference test for layout" width="900" height="219">
              <p>I ran this test to determine what users would value most – viewing larger, but fewer contents at once, or veweing smaller, but more content at once. Mamy prefered the ability to scan more content at once.</p>
              <button type="button">TAKE PREFERENCE TEST</button>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>You have just logged into your cloud storage account to upload a file from your computer. Where would you click to access the option to upload your file?</p>
              <img src="/images/ark-case-study/first-click-test/upload-click-test.png" alt="first-click test for upload button" width="900" height="546">
              <p>Almost all testers were able to determine what to click to upload a file without an “Upload File” button in sight. This feedback assured me I could remove the “Upload File” button to make room for essential sidebar content.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Where would you click to access your list of contacts?</p>

              <p>I originally assumed users would think to click on “Inbox” in the sidebar to access their contacts, but testing proved me wrong and convinced me to add a “Contects” link to the sidebar for direct access to the contents.</p>

            <p>I received useful feedback from testers. Unfortunately, there were a couple of in-person tests I was unable to record due to a bug but was able to make up for them with two more Invision tests, in addition to tests taken through the
              Maze prototype I setup. </p>
            <p>Based on the results, the interface design is mostly intuitive. However, there were a couple of moments in which the Invision interface would interfere with testing as one of the testers could not access a save button in one instance
              and another confused the Invision comment button to be a part of the prototype.</p>
            <p>One of the testers casually mentioned that on other platforms they're notified that their content has saved. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h6>Working with Limitations</h6>
            <p>Due to time restraints of my apprenticeship, I could not address all of the feedback received from testing, critique, and new observations. However, I made sure to make changes I knew would improve the experience. Because this was my
              first big project in which I applied all I learned from boot camp, it was important that I present a thorough walkthrough of my process.</p>
            <p>If given more time, I would have made the following adjustments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Simplify the Notes App</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The interface I currently have for "Notes" should be used for "Documents." It's an assumption I would need to test, but Notes is quite detailed for an app that should be for quick jot-downs. I should also replace the copy I have
                  for "Brainstorm" with really copy instead of using Loreum Ipsum in the final prototype.</li>
              </ul>
</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Create a mobile prototype</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>As I previously mentioned, I do plan to create a mobile prototype and will do so when time permits. I will update this case study, or perhaps create a new one, once it's complete. </li>
              </ul>
</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>More user-testing for assurance</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Refine app features</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Managing Scope Creep</h6>
            <p>Although I incorporated some tactics to help me stay on task, there were times in which I succumbed to ambitions that threw me off focus. For example, I spent a LOT of my time reading and watching tutorials to learn skills I didn't
              have to produce low priority items that I envisioned for the homepage. It took injuring my wrist while working on pixel-perfect illustrations for me to realize that it wasn't my forte, and because it wasn't my forte, I needed to use
              what I know to quickly produce something that works. The reality is that I won't always have the time or resources to present my original vision. The point of an MVP is to fulfill the requirements of the project without over-burdening
              my team, the client, or myself with inessential details.</p>
            <p>Despite not creating the homepage of my original vision, I was able to
              produce one that's within style guidelines, fulfills project requirements, and delivers the message I wanted the brand to communicate to potential customers and stakeholders.</p>
            <h6>To Be or Not to Be Accessible: The Importance of Usability Testing</h6>
            <p>Surprise! Accessibility is not optional, and I was taken aback at how my prototype made it seem otherwise. If I had not made it available for testing or critique, I would have continued to overlook an entire demographic of people as
              potential users of the app.</p>
            <h6>Final Takeaways</h6>
            <p>This experience has been a challenging one. It allowed me to see how far I've come but has also reminded me that I am still learning. My background in journalism taught me how to empathize, but UX is showing me how to be an advocate
              for others beyond communication. By remaining aware of people's needs and listening to their stories, I can give them a voice by presenting them with solutions made with them in mind.</p>
            <p>It's been quite a journey, but I can't wait to apply what I've learned to the next project. I'm looking forward to showing the world what I have to offer and provide it with tools built for the benefit of it and its inhabitants.</p>
