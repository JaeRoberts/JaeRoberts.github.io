          <p> As more individuals and businesses become reliant on cloud storage providers to store their content, the risk of doing so increases with the lack of essential cybersecurity features on even the most popular cloud storage services. In
            this project, I shed a light on these concerns by designing an app that makes such features available to users interested in effectively securing and monitoring their content, while also giving them the ability to create content and
            safely
            collaborate with whomever they choose. </p>

              <p>The core of the problem was to create a cloud storage app that allows for collaboration with others. However, before doing so, I needed to clarify how this app could alleviate existing problems that aren’t being addressed well by
                competitors or could be approached in a different, yet effective, manner.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="solution">
              <p class="content-label"><u>SOLUTION.</u></p>
              <p>By analyzing competitors (Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox) and doing user research, I discovered that there was a need for collaboration-friendly cloud storage services prioritizing user safety with the inclusion of features such as
                private-encryption, heightened password security, and content monitoring. The app should address these concerns in addition to being a stress-free space for creation, collaboration, and the sharing of content with others.</p>

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>Reading user reviews on each competitor notified me of customer attitudes toward certain product features. This information and my prepared SWOT analysis guided my creation of a user survey that would spotlight features that were
              essential enough to include in the MVP. I dispatched the survey on <strong>Reddit’s r/SampleSize</strong> and <strong>Bloc’s various Slack channels.</strong>
              I hoped to find answers to the following questions with the survey:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="list">1. Why do respondents use cloud storage?</li>
              <li class="list">2. Which cloud storage features have benefitted respondents?</li>
              <li class="list">3. Which cloud storage features are most important to respondents?</li>
              <li class="list">4. Which collaboration features are most important to respondents?</li>
              <li class="list">5. What are the motivations and goals of respondents when using cloud storage? Have they been achieved?</li>

            <p>The demographic data gathered from the user survey reveals that respondents come from a variety of different backgrounds. I narrowed down on the appropriate target audience for my app by focusing less on whom the respondents are
              and
              more on the nature of who they are.
              By doing so, I produced the following personas:</p>

                  <h6>Bio</h6>
                  <p>Now in her senior year of college, Aaliyah has a lot to keep up with. Her final academic year is littered with group projects, accompanied with an intensive capstone and intimidating exams that require endless note-taking
                    and concentration. If she’s going to survive the year, she’ll need to worry less about studying harder and instead study smarter. Aaliyah likes to keep track of her life by journaling each day and does candid photo-taking in
                    the city.</p>

                  <h6>Motivations</h6>
                  <p>Aaliyah has had a Google account for quite some time now and a majority of her peers have one too. Always collaborating with other students, she takes class notes in real time with her peers while class is in session.
                    Using cloud storage has also allowed her to keep all of her documents in one place without having to worry about carrying around an external hard drive to free up space on her own computer,  Chromebook. However, the lack of
                    private encryption will become an issue in the future as soon as she begins her professional journalism career.</p>

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>User stories were derived from the motivations, goals, and frustrations of the user personas and revealed specific tasks users should be able to complete in the app to meet their needs. After recording them in a spreadsheet, I
              prioritized them based on importance. This practice helped me keep scope creep at bay throughout the entire process.</p>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Giving my strategy a skeleton let me analyze my interpretation of research results and expose any cracks in the framework that needed redressing. Sketching concepts out on paper allowed me to focus on hierarchy and rapidly sort
              through various layout ideas at a time. The simplicity of sketching prevented me from lingering on distracting details that come with digital wireframing or immediately designing hi-fi mockups. Once finished, I fleshed out my
              wireframes in Sketch and then organized them into a clickable prototype.</p>

              <p>Before running usability tests on my lo-fi prototype, I pushed it through two sessions of <strong>Bloc's Daily Design Critique (DDC)</strong>. At this point, the prototype had an empty state encouraging the users to upload or
                createa file to get started.</p>

            <div class="gallery-container">

                  <p class="caption">This is the original wireframe for Ark’s dashboard empty state before receiving feedback to make it more directional.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="container">
              <p>In the first DDC, I was made aware that a user inexperienced with cloud storage interfaces may be in need of a walk-through for their first interaction. With this in mind, I designed more wireframes that welcome users to the
                app and give them access to a tutorial.</p>

                  <p class="caption">If they decide to begin the tutorial, they would proceed to this screen. This is the first of three screens in the walk-through and presents users with the options they can access in the main navigation.</p>

                <div class="gallery-column1"><img src="./images/ark-case-study/tutorial/tutorial3.png" alt="tutorial step 3">

              <p>I then sent the updated prototype to be reviewed for a second time. The reviewer was not the same person, and the tutorial received a response that somewhat contradicted the feedback I embraced earlier. After completing the
                onboarding process, he was greeted with a welcome screen asking if he would like to proceed to the tutorial.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="quote">“Oh no, a tutorial!” he nervously exclaimed.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Hearing the anxiety in his voice was enough for me to reconsider how I introduced the tutorial. It would need to be presented passively and not in the form of an assertive pop-up. I didn't want users to stop using the app
                because they assumed the interface is complex or had a high learning curve. For now, I would remove the tutorial to test the usability of the site and would address the problem after testing.</p>

              <p><strong>The Brand Name</strong></p>
              <p>I chose “Ark” as the brand name because it means “large box,” which is appropriate for describing a secure cloud storage system. It can also mean “a place of refuge.” </p>

              <p><strong>The Logo</strong></p>
              <p>I originally wanted to take advantage of ark’s homophonic counterpart, “arc,” and use it in branding. However, I chose to use a triangular arch instead. The triangle is considered the most secure shape and its form, embodying

              <p>Cloud storage gives people access to a much larger space beyond their hard drives. I wanted to reflect this by utilizing the idea of "the cloud" and space, both from a cosmic and design perspective. The mood board presents many

              <p><strong>The Right Color Palette</strong></p>
              <p>Choosing a color palette for the brand took contemplation and experimentation. I had a specific look in mind, but what I brewed up in color scheme generators would not suffice. After suffering through enough trial and error, I
                tried
                an alternative method. I extracted colors from the mood board I created for the project and made a few gradients. Here are the results:</p>

              <p>-</p>
              <p>Next, I ran a preference test on <strong>UsabilityHub</strong> to see which one expressed characteristics of the brand best. I received the following feedback:</p>

              <p><strong>The Deal with Gradients</strong></p>
              <p>At first, I assumed gradient logos didn't have many drawbacks when designed properly, but thanks to the feedback received from my preference test, DDC, and additional research, I changed my logo for the following reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="list"><span class="bullet">&#8226;</span>Gradients don’t always transfer well on digital mediums and rarely work well on print</li>

              <p><strong>Updates to the Color Palette</strong></p>
              <p>I experienced some challenges when designing my hi-fi mockups with the heavily blue color palette voted on by testers. The light green primary buttons weren’t as prominent as I would have liked against navy backgrounds,
                especially
                the homepage. It was too monochromatic and needed a pop of color to add warmth and vibrancy to the design. After taking a gander at the color wheel and checking out its psychological properties, orange became the secondary color.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Finding the Right Type</strong></p>
              <p>I chose Roboto Black as the brand typeface and Open Sans as the complementary typeface because of how well the two complements both the weight and personality of the brand and logo. Roboto Black mirrors the structure and weight
                of
                the logo and is also a balanced collaboration of different moods – it’s modern and warm, not too cold or geometric. Open Sans makes a great partner for Roboto because it contrasts Roboto Black in both weight and width.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Challenges with Developing a Brand Identity</strong></p>
              <p>The most challenging part of this phase was understanding the cybersecurity threats to cloud storage services and developing a brand from my limited knowledge. I had to ensure the problem I present through my branding was
                accurate
                and would make sense to the public. More research was necessary.</p>

            <p>In the original design, the hamburger button was used to toggle the sidebar navigation. The Ark word type was placed next to it for the user to recognize the platform they are using at a glance. I did not use the brand type
              because it did not align well with the hamburger button.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After expressing this to my mentor, he suggested I use the brand type to replace both the hamburger button and the word type. This way, I could exhibit the brand type in the app and have it toggle the menu at the same time.</p>

              <h3>Transferring the Mobile Design to Desktop</h3>
              <p>Due to time constraints, I wanted to deliver a desktop version of the app as the MVP. However, I had to provide mobile mockups of the homepage and dashboard during the stage. I took advantage of this opportunity to design mobile
                mockups for each wireframe to gauge the app's responsiveness. Changes were made to the desktop version so that it would be consistent with Android for when I had a chance  to make a mobile prototype later.</p>

          <p>I received useful feedback from testers. Unfortunately, there were a couple of in-person tests I was unable to record due to a bug but was able to make up for them with two more Invision tests, in addition to tests taken through
            the Maze prototype  I setup. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Based on the results, the interface design is mostly intuitive. However, there were a couple of moments in which the Invision interface would interfere with testing as one of the testers could not access a save button in one
            instance and another confused the Invision comment button to be a part of the prototype.</p>

            <h6>Working with Limitations</h6>
            <p>Due to time restraints of my apprenticeship, I could not address all of the feedback received from testing, critique, and new observations. However, I made sure to make changes I knew would improve the experience. Because this was my
              first big project in which I applied all I learned from boot camp, it was important that I present a thorough walkthrough of my process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If given more time, I would have made the following adjustments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="list"><span class="bullet">&#8226;</span><em>Simplify the Notes App</em>
                <ul>
                  <li class="list">The interface I currently have for "Notes" should be used for "Documents." It's an assumption I would need to test, but Notes is quite detailed for an app that should be for quick jot-downs. I should also replace
                    the
                    copy I have for "Brainstorm" with really copy instead of using Loreum Ipsum in the final prototype.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li class="list"><span class="bullet">&#8226;</span><em>Create a mobile prototype</em>
                <ul>
                  <li class="list">As I previously mentioned, I do plan to create a mobile prototype and will do so when time permits. I will update this case study, or perhaps create a new one, once it's complete. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li class="list"><span class="bullet">&#8226;</span><em>More user-testing for assurance</em></li>
              <li class="list"><span class="bullet">&#8226;</span><em>Refine app features</em></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h6>Managing Scope Creep</h6>
            <p>Although I incorporated some tactics to help me stay on task, there were times in which I succumbed to ambitions that threw me off focus. For example, I spent a LOT of my time reading and watching tutorials to learn skills I didn't
              have to produce low priority items that I envisioned for the homepage. It took injuring my wrist while working on pixel-perfect illustrations for me to realize that it wasn't my forte, and because it wasn't my forte, I needed to use
              what I know to quickly produce something that works. The reality is that I won't always have the time or resources to present my original vision. The point of an MVP is to fulfill the requirements of the project without over-burdening
              my team, the client, or myself with inessential details.</p>
            <p>Despite not creating the homepage of my original vision, I was able to
              produce one that's within style guidelines, fulfills project requirements, and delivers the message I wanted the brand to communicate to potential customers and stakeholders.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>To Be or Not to Be Accessible: The Importance of Usability Testing</h6>
            <p>Surprise! Accessibility is not optional, and I was taken aback at how my prototype made it seem otherwise. If I had not made it available for testing or critique, I would have continued to overlook an entire demographic of people as
              potential users of the app.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Final Takeaways</h6>
            <p>This experience has been a challenging one. It allowed me to see how far I've come but has also reminded me that I am still learning. My background in journalism taught me how to empathize, but UX is showing me how to be an advocate
              for others beyond communication. By remaining aware of people's needs and listening to their stories, I can give them a voice by presenting them with solutions made with them in mind.</p>
            <p>It's been quite a journey, but I can't wait to apply what I've learned to the next project. I'm looking forward to showing the world what I have to offer and provide it with tools built for the benefit of it and its inhabitants.</p>
