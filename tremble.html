          <p> <strong>Fans of literary horror:</strong> Wouldn’t it be great to access a library of compelling tales born from diverse minds of those that appreciate horror as much as you? What if you could personalize this library based on your
            preferences and interest and access it anytime, from anywhere? How much easier would it be to seek your next thrill? </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Horror writers:</strong> Can you imagine the benefits of sharing your work on a self-publishing platform that allows horror enthusiasts to find horror stories that align with their interests? What about the amount of feedback
            and engagement on the discussion board for every tale you publish? </p>
          <br>
          <p>Tremble gives users the control they need to feel comfortable exploring the uncomfortable while discovering unique content contributed by the community and for the community. No more rehashes of existing Creepypastas or fan-fiction

              <p>The internet has made horror stories easy to find and share. However, there
                is an absence of interactive, self-publishing platforms dedicated to the needs
                of literary horror enthusiasts.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="problem">
              <p class="content-label"><u>PROCESS.</u></p>
              <p>My first step was research and strategy, with which I discovered there was a
                target audience for a self-publishing app dedicated to horror stories in written
                and audio format. By learning the needs of the target audience through my
                research, I strategized on how I would approach the design of the product
                through information architecture. Then, I created a brand identity for the app
                before proceeding to mockups and building up a prototype or usability testing.
                I made several iterations throughout the design process and applied all feedback
                along the way – all of which you can see in detail further down.

              <p>On Tremble, horror writers can share their work with horror fans wanting to
                experience fear in written or audio format. Users can also tailor their feed
                to their interests and block content of disinterest from their experience
                without penalizing themselves or creators. They can also share, save, and
                discuss stories with others.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <div>
              <p>To ensure there was a market for a horror storytelling platform, I did some research on <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank"><span class="link">Medium</span></a>, <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" target="_blank"><span
                    class="link">Wattpad</span></a>,
                and <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank"><span class="link">Spotify</span></a>, three competitors in the digital media industry that specialize in content searching and two horror storytelling apps. With my findings,
                I was able to answer the following questions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="list">1. How do competitors serve their users? What are the user attitudes toward these services?</li>
                <li class="list">2. What mediums can be used to experience horror? Which of these mediums apply to the problem I am trying to solve?</li>
                <li class="list">3. What services use these mediums for storytelling? What features do these services use? Can they help me solve my problem? </li>
                <li class="list">4. How do the users feel about these services? What are the pain points? How can these services be improved and implemented into my design? </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Asking these questions helped me decide what services I would be analyzing and paved the way for a user survey that would help me uncover the needs of potential target audiences.</p>
              <br>

            <p>My competitive analysis showed me there is room for a horror storytelling app
              that not only allows users to personalize and discover unique horror stories but
              lets them contribute stories themselves. I had the following assumptions based on what I learned:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="list">1. There is an opportunity for a horror storytelling app that focuses on providing high-quality original content to horror enthusiast that enjoy reading and listening to stories.</li>
              <li class="list">2. While black is generally used to indicate mystery on horror story apps, dark text on a white background is easier on the eyes and is essential in this case.</li>
              <li class="list">3. The app should allow users to browse for and search for content in an intuitive manner.</li>
              <li class="list">4. Users should be able to save and bookmark content.</li>
              <li class="list">5. Engagement between users (readers, listeners, and storytellers) will help keep the community alive and growing</li>
              <li class="list">6. Sharing content is important because:
                <ol>
                  <li class="list">a. Users can share their favorite stories (and the app) with other horror fans</li>
                  <li class="list">b. It’s an opportunity for authors and their stories to become known externally</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>However, although there seems to be a space for this app, is there an audience for it? Whose needs can I fulfill with the app, and how could I best meet those needs?</p>

            <p>I ran two surveys. The first was designed to uncover trends in storytelling preferences for
              storytellers, their audiences, and those who play both roles. The second helped me discover
              trends in horror story preferences from those who enjoy experiencing horror stories through
              a variety of mediums. I posted the surveys on <strong>Reddit’s r/SampleSize</strong> and <strong>Bloc’s various Slack channels.</strong> These are the highlights:</p>

            <p>I would have liked to extend the run time for the storytelling preferences survey
              a bit longer to gain at least 30 more responses for a sample size of 100
              respondents. I would have also liked to run another survey for audiences and
              storytellers to explore what their desired experience would be when interacting
              with a self-publishing app.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The most challenging aspect of user research was finding the right wording for
              the title of the survey and survey questions. For example, “Storytelling Survey”
              can mean a variety of things and is a bit vague, but “Storytelling Preferences”
              expresses that I will be asking respondents about their taste in storytelling
              methods.</p>

              <h3>User Interviews</h3>
              <p>I conducted five remote interviews with horror enthusiasts between the ages
                of 18-35 that live in the United States. I learned about the variety of experiences
                each interviewee had with searching for stories online. Almost all commented on
                how the internet made horror stories more accessible.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>The Importance of Community, Intimacy, and Maintaining a Schedule</strong></p>
              <p>My first interview was with Josh, a former Wattpad user. From his experience, Wattpad
                does not uphold a standard that will improve the quality of work on the site. As a user,
                he spent time reading several stories that he eventually abandoned due to authors not
                committing to a consistent publishing schedule. Some stories were not updated for months
                and without warning. Did the authors desert their work and their readers? How could this be
                prevented?</p>
              <br>
              <p>My final interview was with Naja, who believes hearing someone tell a story is a more
                communal and intimate experience than reading. She also considers stories that are
                fleshed out and don’t cater to an audience to be more enjoyable. “Fear is vulnerable.
                It forces the audience to go in the darkest pits of their minds. Horror stories need to
                be thought out, and writers cannot afford to be lazy." </p>
              <br>
              <p>As a writer herself, Naja thinks self-publishing is a great way for authors to have
                their work discovered while avoiding the "B.S. of the publishing house block."</p>
              <br>
              <p>Here are more opinions gathered from my interviews:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="list">1. It can be difficult finding free horror audiobooks</li>
                <li class="list">2. Difficult to find translations for foreign horror stories</li>
                <li class="list">3. Audio stories are atmospheric and great for when multitasking</li>
                <li class="list">4. Horror stories online are better than those in libraries – innovative and new</li>
                <li class="list">5. Horror is most powerful when combining mediums</li>
                <li class="list">6. Experiencing horror with others makes the experience more exciting</li>
                <li class="list">7. Free stories matter more than quality</li>
                <li class="list">8. Quality of stories may improve with incentives</li>
              </ol>

            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>After reviewing survey results and the notes I took for each interview, I created
              three user personas that would help me layout my target audience’s various backgrounds,
              goals, needs, and motivations. Creating these characters helped me refine initial requirements
              and land on tasks that were essential enough to be considered for the MVP.

                  <h6>Bio</h6>
                  <p>John is a single father of one who spends most of the day working as a customer service
                    representative at a local gym. When he's not working, he divides his time between his passions
                    – filmmaking and voice-acting – and bonding with his 8-year-old son. More often than not, he
                    does them simultaneously and brings his kid to gigs when allowed. John hopes to make a living
                    off his passions someday. His hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, watching movies with his son,
                    writing and filmmaking.</p>

                    fail to meet his expectations due to a lack of authenticity, distractions from typos, and unpleasant
                    formatting of written pieces. John is also looking to publish his work for others to enjoy and would
                    like to do so on a platform that values horror and quality over quantity.</p>

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>When I first created user stories, they consisted of five different users: new users, returning users,
              the storyteller, the audience, and the editor. However, because I was creating an MVP, I revised my user
              stories to reflect the actions that would fulfill project requirements while meeting user needs. I organized
              tasks by user role and prioritized their importance based on project requirements and survey findings.

              <p>The user stories helped me create user flows that would illustrate a journey through

              <h3>Casual Testing, Wireframes, and Content Strategy</h3>
              <p>With a sitemap and content strategy done, I roughly sketched out the screens I planned to include
                in the prototype based on my user flows, which were followed by detailed paper prototypes for
                usability testing. I performed my tests casually, having friends and family complete tasks by
                interacting with the paper prototypes. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Based on the feedback I recieved, the design was easy
                to navigate. I then worked on a content strategy to define the structure I wanted to give each
                page before creating a brand identity.</p>

              <h3>Branding Work</h3>
              <p>Looking back on my research, I did not want the branding for the app to
                be outright terrifying. In the horror storytelling survey, I asked
                respondents what their least favorite type of horror was. The majority
                answered with "gore" and "slasher" horror, so I made a note to exclude
                visceral and violent imagery from branding. I assumed this to be the case,
                but it's great to have data backing me up.</p>
              <br>
              <p>While the point of the app is to be a literary haven for horror lovers,
                it must function as a tool that introduces horror to those who have never
                sought it before. Such people would be children and those sensitive to
                visual horror. To make exploring the uncomfortable comfortable, I wanted
                to go for characteristics like weird and odd. In what ways could the app
                be offputting, yet inviting?</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>The Brand Name</strong></p>
              <p>The first step I took with branding was coming up with a name. It was
                difficult at first. With all the listmaking and mind-mapping I did, I
                couldn't come up with a name that best represented the personality and
                purpose of the app. Every word I came up with sounded like something I
                heard before. I reached out to my friends and family, told them my issue,
                and they helped me brainstorm based on what I wanted the name to convey.
                With their help, I decided on Tremble because of how it evokes a familiar
                feeling associated with experiencing discomfort, terror, horror, and repulsion. </p>

              <p><strong>Moodboard</strong></p>
              <p>The moodboard I created had images from cinematic horror - vibrant blues, yellows, purples,
                greens, and reds that played significant roles in movies. I drew inspiration from horror comics,
                drawings, eyes, and cinema.

              <p><strong>Brand Color</strong></p>

              <p>Because red is often associated with elements of horror – blood, evil,
                and anger – I attempted to try something different by checking out stills
                from horror cinema with excellent cinematography. I decided I would use
                green as my primary color, red as a secondary color, with black and white
                as my background colors. I chose green because instead of going for
                something outright horrific, I felt it would give Tremble a ghoulish vibe
                – enough to be considered creepy. </p>

              <div class="original-palette">
                <div class="color-1">

              </div>
              <br>
              <p>However, I shared my reasoning with peers and my design mentor, and the
                feedback I received made me reconsider:</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p class="quote">"The green makes me think of aliens."</p>
              <br>
              <p class="quote">"The green makes your LOGO look like an alien."</p>

              <p class="quote">"I don't see horror, but I do see sci-fi."</p>
              <br>
              <p class="quote">"I'm reminded of toxins."</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Not what I expected, but I decided not to fight the obvious. A
                dangerous, ominousness, bloody red was the way to go. Typical for the genre,
                but it gets the point across. I also replaced black with a dark navy, which
                is a bit softer and reminiscent of a night sky.</p>

              <p><strong>The Logo</strong></p>
              <p>I did a lot of brainstorming and sketched out different concepts for
                Tremble's logo. I wanted to incorporate eyes into the logo because the
                fear of being watched can creep up on someone invested in a good horror
                story. After going through many ideas and formats, I decided to create a
                logo mascot to pair with a logotype as the official logo.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I designed a variety of mascots using different looks and colors. After
                sharing the designs with others and getting feedback, I chose my winner. </p>

            <p>I chose <strong>Libre Baskerville</strong> as the brand font because, while the Baskerville typeface has a history
              of being used in books, Libre Baskerville is more legible on digital devices. <strong>Source Sans Pro</strong>
              contrasts Libre Baskerville well and adds a modern touch when the two are paired together, creating
              a perfect pairing to uphold Tremble’s brand personality.</p>

                in Sketch while applying the branding decisions I made
                earlier. It was here that I could examine whether my
                content strategy was successful or not, from my perspective
                at the time.</p>
              <br>
              <p>One thing I struggled with here was finalizing my color
                palette. Applying green as a primary accent color and red
                as a secondary accent color was not exhibiting the user
                experience I was trying to give. The palette was hard,
                and I received feedback that it was evocative of science
                fiction, toxins, and aliens – not a hint of the ghastliness
                I was trying to convey. </p>
              <br>
              <p>My desire to avoid using red as a primary color was getting
                in the way of the practicality of using what makes sense.
                Logic won in the end, and I decided to go with a nightly
                theme instead, replacing black with a dark navy and using
                red as the primary accent color.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It was also tough finding suitable visuals for empty states.
                There weren't many horror-related visuals out there, so I
                got creative with my UX writing to connect the visuals I
                chose with the app experience.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li class="list">a. One of the biggest reasons for Tremble
                      is to help people become comfortable with being uncomfortable.
                      With this in mind, I thought it necessary to include a blocking
                      system to give users control over the content they see in the app.
                      I didn't have time to expand on this and didn't want to put much
                      focus on it in the MVP, but I did want to show the feature was
                      available for use. I received feedback that it would be beneficial
                      to give users a warning before they land on the "Block Content"
                      screen with the option to skip it. I agreed to add it. The last thing
                      I want to do is throw a user off the app before they make it through
                      the onboarding process.

              <p>After updating my mockups, I shared them with my mentor,
                who recommended I transfer them from Sketch to Figma for
                prototyping. It wasn't until I did this that I noticed how
                big the image files in my mockups were. They were pretty
                massive files, so I decreased their sizes and optimized them,
                which sped up the loading time of my project.</p>

                  the navigation from the rest of the page was mistaken as
                  an "empty space" by a tester, who suggested an opportunity
                  for user customization. While I want the app design to be
                  consistent for all users, I did like the idea and applied
                  it. IF I had more time, I would have liked to gather more
                  opinions on adding such a feature.

              <ol>
                <li class="list">a. During the user survey, it took testers a moment to figure out
                  where to go to create a story. While clicking the "Story" tab in the bottom
                  navigation was the right direction for completing the task and eventually where
                  testers ended up, they initially assumed this path would lead to more stories.

                  <br>
                  Realizing this miscommunication, I revisited the bottom navigation and changed
                  "Stories" to "Create." I also changed "Search" to "Explore" because it better
                  communicated the purpose of the screen linked to it.

          <h3>Assessment Feedback</h3>
          <p class="feedback-types">Assessor suggestion: Refine "Create Story" process</p>
          <p>After I updated the clickable prototype, I presented my project
            to a senior designer. With the feedback I received, I decided to
            refine the user experience for creating a story on the app. My
            assessor's recommendation was that I create two separate paths
            for publishing content – one for written content and one for
            audio content – because the option to upload a story was not
            immediately visible to the user with the "Write Story"
            button. </p>

            <p class="content-label"><u>Conclusion</u></p>
            <p>If I had more time to expand more on the project, I would have loved
              to create a website design prototype as well. I decided on a
              mobile-first approach because, based on my research, having a mobile
              prototype would meet users' needs. However, I was also aware that having
              an online version of Tremble would be essential to its success as a
              self-publishing platform. I assumed users would rather type out stories
              on a PC instead of mobile, so having a website version of Tremble to
              show would have been a nice touch.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my original user stories did not make it to the mockup
              stage. I did not want to overwhelm myself with unessential
              features that did not have to be included in the MVP for it
              to be complete. If I had more time, I would have liked to
              expound on the following:</p>

            <ol>
              <li class="list">1. Refine the explore page by adding sorting and filtering features</li>
              <li class="list">2. Added a collaborative system for translating stories</li>
              <li class="list">3. Include user stories for an editor-type user</li>
              <li class="list">4. Add manage account and edit profile processes</li>
              <li class="list">5. Do more testing and research</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Instead, I chose to focus on designing a prototype that
              allows for the following tasks to be completed:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="list">1. Self-publishing written and audio content</li>
              <li class="list">2. Reading and listening to stories</li>
              <li class="list">3. Discussing stories with others</li>
              <li class="list">4. Personalizing the user experience</li>
              <li class="list">5. Allow users to gain exposure and acquire a following</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a horror fan, I enjoyed working on this project. It gave
              me a chance to explore a problem I am familiar with and attempt
              to solve it by applying what I’ve learned as a student
              apprentice at Bloc.</p>
